‘Recommanime’ app is very straightforward and easy to use. Simply typing any animation that you like and hitting the enter or return will lead you to the results with the top two recommendations which are likely to satisfy your animation taste. You will view the relevant YouTube video and ten recent Tweets of each recommended animation before you decide to watch and dig into those animation spending a lot of time.
